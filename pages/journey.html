            I chose Vancouver, Canada for my first long-term study abroad. I
            plan to stay for a year and a half in ESL and COOP. Currently, I am
            learning HTML and CSS in Tamwood Career's web development course.
            Learning new things in English is extremely difficult and I am
            overwhelmed with assignments every day.
          </p>
          <p class="post-paragraph">
            Vancouver is a truly international city, where I use English every
            day and have experiences that I couldn't have in Japan. It's also a
            beautiful city where nature and the city are fused, and just taking
            a walk on a sunny day will make me feel good.
          </p>
          <p class="post-paragraph last-paragraph">
            I haven't traveled in Canada yet, but I would like to go to Toronto,
            Banff, and see the Northern Lights. My favorite places in Vancouver
            are Granville Island and North Vancouver.

            During my five-month stay in Canada, I went to San Francisco and New
            York. I'm going to Seattle next month. While studying in Canada, I
            would also like to visit Los Angeles.

            In San Francisco, I went to Alcatraz island, Golden Gate Bridge,

            the cable car around San Francisco. Also, since I went at the end of
            the year, I watched the New Year's fireworks and celebrated the new
            year.

            In New York, I visited the Statue of Liberty, the Empire State

            very enjoyable trip to New York. I was nervous as it was my first
            solo trip, but I was able to make some great memories.

            As part of my university graduation trip, I participated in a tour
            of Turkey and Egypt. In Turkey, I was able to visit many major
            tourist destinations and world heritage sites such as Istanbul,
            Cappadocia, Pamukkale, and Troy.
          </p>
          <p class="post-paragraph">
            Above all, Istanbul was a truly wonderful place that blended the
            atmosphere of Europe and Asia. I was also able to see many important
            architectures related to the Ottoman Empire and the Byzantine
            Empire, giving me a sense of Turkey's magnificent history. My
            recommendation is Hagia Sophia. The inside is truly beautiful, and
            the murals depicting Christ and Arabic letters tell the story of
            Istanbul's long and complex history.
          </p>
          <p class="post-paragraph last-paragraph">
            I'm glad I was able to go to Cappadocia, which I've always wanted to
            see. I stayed at a famous cave hotel and had a valuable experience.

            As part of my university graduation trip, I participated in a tour
            of Turkey and Egypt. It was my first time to go to Africa, and of
            course, it was my first time seeing a desert. The real pyramids and
            Sphinx were huge and impressive. Each stone in the pyramid is almost
            the size of a car.
          </p>
          <p class="post-paragraph last paragraph">
            The mystery why such things were created in ancient times, and what
            they were created for, became deepen. I also rode a camel. The
            sitting height was higher than I expected, which was a bit scary,
            but the camels were very cute and I love them. I saw so many mummies
            at the museum. I think Egypt is the only place in the world where
            you can see so many mummies. It was a great place, as the culture,
            town atmosphere, and food culture were completely different from
            Japan.
